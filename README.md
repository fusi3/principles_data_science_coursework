I present an analysis specific to New York City, USA, looking at data from 2017 to 2022. I look to understand if prices for healthcare have significantly increased and if certain groups of people are affected by this. As the  data explored, there is a significant difference between prices with high dispersion at the minor illness level. Further exploration reveals that multi-ethnic groups for minor illnesses have the highest variability for their cost of care and tend to cluster near the Manhatten area in New York.
